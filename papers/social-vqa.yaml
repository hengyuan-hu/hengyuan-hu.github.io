description: "We equip robots with commonsense reasoning skills by enabling them to\
  \ actively gather missing information from the environment.\n                To\
  \ reason in the real world, robots must go beyond passively querying LLMs and actively\
  \ gather information from the environment that is required to make the right decision.\
  \ We propose an approach that leverages an LLM and vision language model (VLM) to\
  \ help a robot actively perceive its environment to perform grounded commonsense\
  \ reasoning"
